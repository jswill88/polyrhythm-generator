# Polyrhythm Generator

This app allows you to hear examples of different polyrhythms and see a live visualization. Pick two numbers and the app will calculate how they match up and demonstrate it using Tone.js. Rectangles light up to match with the rhythms so you can easily see what is happening. You can change the speed, volume, and the note for each rhythm. Press play to hear the polyrhythm.
