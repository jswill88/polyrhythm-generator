      <h2>About this tool:</h2>

      <p>Learning polyrhtyhms is a great way to improve your rhythmic understanding. It can be difficult to find examples of specific polyrhythms, so Polyrhythm Generator allows you to hear and see any polyrhythm in isolation. This will ensure that you can practice polyrhythms with precision.</p>

      <p>Some good polyrhythms to start with are 2:3, 3:2, 3:4, and 4:3. Tap your left hand along with the base rhythm and your right hand along with the cross rhythm. Make sure you match the beat perfectly. Start slowly and increase the speed as you get comfortable. Once you have those down, try increasing the number of beats. Have fun!</p>
